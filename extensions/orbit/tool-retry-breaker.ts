/**
 * Tell the model when it is resending a call that keeps failing the same way.
 *
 * A small model handed an error it cannot fix tends to resend the call
 * unchanged, or change something that doesn't matter, and grind there for as
 * many turns as the user lets it (#617). Once the same tool, called with the
 * same arguments, has failed with the same first line of error in a few model
 * turns in a row, the result gets a note saying so and telling the model to
 * change approach or ask the user. The call itself still runs: the Galaxy
 * repeat guard is the one that refuses, and only for Galaxy tools.
 *
 * Streaks are counted in model turns, not results. pi runs a turn's tool calls
 * in parallel and hands their results over in completion order, so counting
 * results would let an unrelated call in the same batch break the streak every
 * turn, and would count three copies of one call in a single batch as three
 * tries when the model has not yet seen any of the errors. A turn in which the
 * call didn't fail -- it succeeded, failed differently, or the model did
 * something else -- ends the streak.
 *
 * Any tool counts, and a result counts as failed when pi marks it an error or
 * the tool sets `details.error`: Orbit's own tools return their rejections
 * that way, as text the model is meant to read.
